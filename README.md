This is a toyi toyi against ridiculous restaurant prices in the Sandton area, before you buy, compare and save your hard earned cheese

I will use Python stack for this project where I scrape websites to display commonalities and their pricing. We know most of them sell liquor, steak and salads, well, lets see how they ar priced.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Python (Flask for the server, Beautiful, Requests and Regexes for the scraper)
Frontend: React JS 


Why Flask?

Well, web scraping ought not to be  humongous project except if the aim is to overtake google and index the dark web! I am trying a fun project, light and easy to follow and hence Flask seems to fit the bill.


Once our server is up...well we get busy


Why React:

I am a React man, and I will use React to add dynamism to the client side so that there is a bit of fun when using the site.
